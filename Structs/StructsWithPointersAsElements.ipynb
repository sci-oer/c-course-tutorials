    "# Structs with Pointers as Elements\n",
    "\n",
    "Including pointers as an element in a struct works in much the same way as including any data type as an element to a struct. Once we include a pointer, we just have to allocate it and use it as usual. \n",
    "\n",
    "One thing to look out for, just like with 2D pointers, you have to free them from the inside out. If you free a struct you've allocated before freeing the pointers inside it, you'll leak memory. We'll show that here."
