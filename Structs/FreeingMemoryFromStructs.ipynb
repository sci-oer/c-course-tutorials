    "# Freeing Memory From Structs\n",
    "\n",
    "Freeing memory from structs is a lot like freeing memory from 2D pointers. We want to free from the inside out so we don't lose access to the inner pointers.\n",
    "In this example we're going to dynamically allocate an array of Rectangle Structs and their name values (Strings/char *). After that, we'll show how to free those Rectangle's names and the Rectangle pointer itself without leaking memory."
